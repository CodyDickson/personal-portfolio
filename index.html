Game sessions are short and can be completed in a few minutes. This website was designed using Bootstrap for the visual structure and extensive JavaScript for the game mechanics. There is also a rudimentary AI that runs the opponent's turn and makes decisions. The game itself is based on an old card and dice game I created a few years ago, heavily modified to function in the browser. I am aware that it looks ugly but I am a programmer, not an artist.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/CodyDickson/castles-game" target="_blank">View the GitHub Repository here.</a></p></div>

One of the requirements was to feature all of the projects we worked on throughout the website. This website also features some JavaScript tricks that I learned from this course, including a Feedback Form with form validation and an entry box which returns the length of a user-input string. The projects I completed for this course were a lot of fun and covered a wide range of JavaScript skills.</p></div>
